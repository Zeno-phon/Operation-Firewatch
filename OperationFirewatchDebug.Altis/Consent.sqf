<t font='PuristaBold'>Indiana University Informed Consent Statement for a Study on Human-Automation Interaction</t><br/><br/>

You are invited to participate in a study on Human-Automation Interaction. Please read this statement and ask any questions you may have before agreeing to participate in the study. The study is being conducted by Eric S. Vorm from the IU School of Informatics and Computing. The study is open to participants who meet the following criteria: 18 or older; proficient, fluent, or native ability in spoken and written English communication; visual impairment no worse than 20/40 with correction; agree to this informed consent statement.<br/><br/>

<t font='PuristaBold'>Study purpose</t><br/>
The purpose of this study is to explore how human workload level, situation awareness, and rate of utilization change with different degrees of automation. We are interested in learning more about how different types of automated functions can affect human performance. Possible outcomes of this research could help improve system designs using automation in domains such as aviation (manned and unmanned) and process control.<br/><br/>

<t font='PuristaBold'>Procedures for the study</t><br/>
If you agree to participate in this study, you will do the following things:<br/>
    1. Answer some questions about yourself, such as your experience in aviation training or flight simulators, and basic demographics like your birth year, gender, and so on.<br/>
    2. Take part in a simulation controlling multiple remotely piloted aircraft to help monitor for simulated forest fires. <br/>
    3. Answer questions during the simulation.<br/><br/>
